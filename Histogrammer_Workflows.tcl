#
# init: creates project, adds hls and test bench files to it, and create solution with FPGA conf and clock

# solution_init: creates solution with FPGA conf and clock
# run_c_sim: builds and runs C simulation
# run_rtl_sim: builds and runs RTL simulation
# synth: synthetise the code
# setup: opens a project and a solution
